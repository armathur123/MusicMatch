# MusicMatch
Built with React-Native and the Spotify API to compare the music tastes of two different users.

global.cli is not a function fix:
1. delete node packages
2. npm install expo
3. expo install
4. make sure react-native-reanimated sdk version is set to 2.2.4 in package.json

Node -v: 16.13.2
NPM -v: 8.1.3
